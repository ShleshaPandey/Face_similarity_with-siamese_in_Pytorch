# **Project Title**
Face Recognition with Siamese Network

## **Description**
This project aims to provide a face recognition solution using a Siamese Network architecture. The model is trained on the AT&T dataset, allowing it to extract meaningful features or representations from input images. By leveraging these representations, the system can accurately detect similarities between any two faces, enabling robust face recognition capabilities.

## Key Features  
Utilizes the Siamese Network architecture for face recognition.
Trained on the AT&T dataset to extract effective facial representations.
Enables similarity detection between pairs of faces.
Provides a reliable face recognition solution
.
## Usage

Ensure the model is trained and saved in a desired location.
Use the provided functions or APIs to load the model and perform face recognition tasks.
Provide input images to the model and retrieve dissimilarity scores.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
